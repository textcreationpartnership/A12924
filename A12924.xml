         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Howbeit ſaith he when the tenant is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſell his land, the lorde ſhalbee preferred to the ſale therof before a ſtranger geuing as muche as an other will.

For this ſtatute of Prerogatiue goeth but to that where his tenaunt in chiefe alieneth the greateſt parte without lycence, <hi>Ergo</hi> He may alien the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer parte without lycence, and ſo doth the ſtatute expreſſely ſet it forth, except you will ſaye there bee twoe licences vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded here, that is to ſaye a generall lycence by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the commen law, and a ſpecial licence by this ſtatute, thone to be requiſite where any parcell is ſold, thother whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the more parcel is ſolde. Therfore enquire and learne what other mens oppinions are vpon this ſtatute.

And where this ſtatute of Prerogatiue ſpeaketh onely but of knyghtes ſeruice, the lawe is otherwiſe taken. For if one do holde of the kinges highnes in Socage in chief he can alien no pece without lycence. Then let vs ſee what thinges maye bee graunted or done without lycence and at what tyme: And howe the tenaunts that hath lycence ſhall purſue the ſame.

But the reaſon why that aduowſons ſhoulde paſſe in the kings caſe by the order of the common lawe thoughe it were not expreſſed in the graunt was this I ſuppoſe, becauſe that landes or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nementes were not then compted as thinges that touched the roiall eſtate or that made the kynges crowne lyke as Liberties or fraunchiſes did. For the one a comon perſone might haue as well as the kinge, but the other none might haue but the king or ſuche as were able to ſhewe his grant therof, and therefore ſaith <hi>Bracton</hi> in his firſt booke vnder the title <hi>que res dari poſſint</hi> that for landes <hi>currit tempus contra regem ſicut contra quamlibet priuatam perſonam</hi> Which is as much to ſay, that if the king had right to any ſuch landes or tenementes and hadde ſurceſſed his time ſo longe, that it exceeded the time of limitation in a write of right, his highnes hadde loſt then his right for euer. And herewith agreeth <hi>Briton</hi> fo. 29. But that is (ſaith <hi>Britton</hi>) of landes, parcell of the kinges eſchetes or pourchaſed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18351:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> landes, and not of the auncient demeaſnes of his crowne, for of thoſe <hi>nullum currit ei tempus,</hi> if hee haue anye righte to demaunde them. So that by <hi>Britton</hi> this reaſon will not ſerue for landes parcel of the crowne. <hi>Ideo quere vera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rationem.</hi> Howbeit ſince this ſtatute made, what landes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be thoſe thinges that are compriſed in this ſtatut paſſe not without making expreſſe mencion therof.

And if the kinge render vp to him that was in warde, at ful age, his landes, or to a biſhopp his temporalties, although he make no mencion of knights fees or auouſons, yet all paſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, for like as the kinges ſeiſine in ſuche caſe is by theſe woordes <hi>omnia terra et tenementa,</hi> without ſpeakinge of fees or auowſons, euen ſo being ſued out of his handes by theſe woordes, <hi>omnia terre et tenementa,</hi>

Where after the death of an ydeot, the king rendred againe the lands to the heire not making me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of fees or auouſons, &amp; yet he had them. And likewiſe 41. et 44. E. 3. the kinge graunted the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties to one that was elect biſhop before he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrat,<note place="margin">H. 41. E. 3. f 44.

But what then? they claim not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole lande that is in the kinges hands but only par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell therof, &amp; then thauouſon euermore abydeth with that that remaines, if expreſſe mencion be not made therof, and ſo not like the caſes before where the king makes liuerie of the whole. And this caſe appeareth alſo in the ſaid booke of 5. E. 3. And note that in al caſes wher y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſeiſeth a thing as his owne proper right as he doth in the caſe of wardes, eſchete, &amp; ſuch like, there nothinge paſſeth by Graunt of the appurtenance if expreſſe mencion be not made of the thinge that is appurtenant by name: &amp; therfore the caſe was .29.

Thus may ye ſee how bokes vary in this matter, and yet by the waye note this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that is to ſaye, where by the firſte office the heire is founde within age and were of full age, for by theſe bokes it ſhoulde ſeeme that if hee bee firſte founde withein age, notwithſtandyng that by an other office an other is found heire and of full age, yet hee ſhall not enterplede with the other tyll he bee of age, contrarie it is yf the fyrſt be found of full age, and the nexte wythin age, and the reaſon may be for that the kynge is firſt ſeyſed of hym y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is wythyn age, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whom the lawe weyes more in preſumption to bee heire than the other, and thys tytle ys the beſte tytle that the kynge hathe, for it entytlethe hys higheneſſe to a greater benefite than dothe the ſeconde office, and thys ſecond was found vpon a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion graunted more for the kings benefit tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heries that ſhould be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame

Alſo the ſayde Iuſtice <hi>Towneſend</hi> ſayde further, that if one bee founde heire in one countie &amp; an other found heire in an other countie, yet they ſhall enterplede, whyche can not bee as me ſeemethe: for once wee haue a generall grounde that a man can not ſue a generall lyuerie by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles but firſte he muſte cauſe an office to be founde in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye ſhere where he haue landes, and when all the offices be returned, then to haue his lyuerie and not beefore, then this caſe where one is founde heire in one ſheere and an other in an other ſheere, heare none of them bothe canne haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye, beecauſe hee hathe noe office founde butte in one ſheere and not in the other: and thenne if there canne be noe liuerie there can be noe enterpleder, wherfore it ſhould ſeme in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> caſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terplede.<note place="margin">2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So it is where the kynges ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is in righte of anye other, as if one bee founde heire by office, and after by another office an other is founde heire
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18351:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the ſame landes to the ſelfe ſame aunceſtour, in this caſe he that was firſt found heire cannot haue his generall ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie vntill ſuche time as hee hathe deſtroied the other title either by an enterpleder or a trauerſe, for if it ſo come to paſſe that he cannot enterplede, then muſt hee trauerſe or by ſome other meanes auoide the recorde ere hee can haue his ſaide generall liueries, and if he ſue his generall liuerie otherwiſe, it is then miſſued, and a good cauſe geeuen to the king to reſeiſe. And this enterpleder or trauerſe bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them that claime as heirs is by the order of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawe and not by ſtatute, and can neuer be, but where both theire titles bee founde firſt by office, and the reaſon is, becauſe that as ſone as the matter is diſcuſſed betweene them, hee for whome it is founde ſhall forthwith haue hys general liuerie, which he can neuer haue if his title bee not firſt founde by office: and therefore not like the caſe where a ſtraunger trauerſeth with the kinge that is to haue but an <hi>ouſter le maine,</hi> for there the kinge hadde no right too ſeiſe, and therefore his tytle nede not to bee found by offyce as I haue ſaide before. But in the other caſe who ſo euer ſhall claime the lande as heire, his highnes hath right to ſeiſe in the right of the ſaide heire, and to haue his primer ſeiſine or wardſhippe as the caſe dothe require. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his title muſt bee firſt founde by office: but where one heire is to trauerſe with an other heire duringe the kinges poſſeſſion, this ſhall not bee vntill hee that is firſt founde heire by thoffice come of age, becauſe vntil that tyme, the landes ought to remaine in the kinges handes and then hee to haue liuerie: but whether hee that was firſte founde heire ſhoulde tarrye for thage of him that was laſte founde heire I haue ſaid my mynde therin before in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tytle of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpleder.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. And ſo there appeareth to bee a great difference bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene a trauerſe taken by him that is a ſtraunger, and by him that is heire. But at this daye moſte liueries that bee ſued are ſpecyall liueries, whiche conteine in them ſelues a pardone, and therefore the myſſuinge of them is diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall by the woordes of the pardone conteined in the ſaide liuerie. And ſo manye of theſe thinges that I haue ſpoken of before are not much to bee obſerued if the liuerie or <hi>Ouſter le maine</hi> bee not generall. For I ſee no lett but that an <hi>ouſter le maine</hi> maye be graunted ſpecially as well as a liuerie. And laſte of all it is to bee noted that this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe extendes not to euerie recorde that entitleth the king, but onelye to ſuche recordes as bee trauerſable, as an office or ſuche like, as I ſhall ſhewe my mynde therein more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in the chapter of Peticion.

E. 3. fo. 26. Then further. The woordes of the ſaide ſtatutes of anno 36. bee, that if anye came before the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler and ſhewe his right, whereby it may appere by good euidence that hee hathe an auncient righte and good tytle, then the chaunceller ſhall let the ſaide landes to the partye that tendeth the trauerſe yeldinge to the kinge the value if it bee aiudged for the king, in maner as hee and the other Chaunceller haue done before him by theire good diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that hee to whome it ſhalbe letten finde ſuretie to doe no waſte or deſtruccion beefore the trauers bee diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. By the woordes of this ſtatute it ſhoulde appeare that the Chauncellours before this time by theire diſcrecions hadde vſed to let the landes to the partie to ferme,<note place="margin">Quare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit p. 34.</note> and that is true, for the kinge vſed ſo to doe vppon a peticion whiche was made to his highnes by the order of the common law in ſteede of a trauerſe nowe vſed, as appeareth 5. Edward 3.<note place="margin">Trauers, 12.</note> and therefore I thinke his highnes may do ſo at this day bothe vpon a peticion and a <hi>Monſtrance de droit,</hi> although the ſtatute make no mencion thereof, for ſo it was vſed to doe by order of the common lawe, as it appeareth by the booke before. And of this matter ſee the booke .3. Henrye .7. Now is this ſtatut amplified and made plainer in thys point by the ſtatute made in the .8. yeare Henrie .8. the .26. chapter, whiche will that no landes or tenementes ſeyſed into the kinges handes vppon enqueſt taken before eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours or commiſſioners bee in anye wiſe graunted or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ferme by the Chaunceller or Treſorer of Englande or anye other the kinges officers, till the ſaide enqueſtes or verdites bee retourned fullye intoo the Chauncerie or theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, but all that time ſhall abide in the kinges handes and by a moneth after the ſaide retourne, if it bee not ſo that hee or they that feele themſelues greeued by the
<pb facs="tcp:18351:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſaide enqueſt or that are put out of theire landes and tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes come into the chauncerie and offer to trauerſe the ſaide enqueſtes and to take the ſaide lande or tenementes to ferme, whiche if they doe then the ſaide Chauncellour, Treſorer, or other officer ſhal let them haue them to ferme ſhewinge good euidence, prouing theire trauerſe to be true accordinge to the forme of the ſtatute of an .36. E. 3. to holde till the iſſue vppon the ſaide trauerſe taken bee founde and diſcuſſed for the kinge or elles for the partie, and alſo fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge ſufficient ſuertie too purſue the ſaide Trauers with effecte, and to render to the kinge the yearely value of the tenementes whereof the trauerſe ſhalbee ſo taken, if it bee diſcuſſed for the kinge. And if anye Letters patentes of anye landes or tenementes bee made to anye other parſon to the contrarie, then the ſame to be void after the moneth. Hereuppon is to bee noted that the ſhewinge of the euyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is onelye reherſed to the lettynge of the landes to ferme &amp; not to the trauerſe, For by this ſtatute hee maye trauerſe without ſhewinge anye euydence, but not haue the landes to ferme. Alſo by theſe Statutes hee is not bounde to noe certeine tyme for takinge of hys trauers, but onelye for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of the landes to forme, for hee maye tende hys tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe when hee will ſo hee deſire not the ferme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lands, But if hee will haue them to ferme hee muſt tend his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers within the moneth, as appeareth .P. 13. E. 4. fo. 8. and nowe by the ſtatute of anno. 1. H. 8. ca. 9. hee hath three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes libertie to doe it. Alſo note the thinges that he muſt fynde ſuertie for, that is to ſay, to ſue with effecte, to paye the rent after the trauers bee diſcuſſed, and to doe no waſte or deſtruccion. In this woorde rent is emplyed all the arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of the rent that ſhall encurre meane betwene the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge of the ferme and the diſcuſſinge of the trauerſe and yet it is not ſo expreſſed. Alſo the leaſe that is made to hym
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18351:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> that tendes the trauerſe is not of anye terme certeine, but onelye by theſe woordes <hi>Donec diſcuſſum fuerit,</hi> for the woordes of the ſtatute bee ſo, and therefore as ſoone as the trauerſe is founde againſte him that tendeth it by and by the leaſe hee hadde in the landes by force of the Statute is voide, as apperethe in .4.

But if hee that tended the trauerſe bee founde heire by office, and is to haue liuerie of that lande as well as the other that was firſt founde heire, otherwiſe it is for the reaſon made bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

And note alſo that the ſaide ſtatute. 1.

Let vs ſee what it is, &amp; in what caſes it lieth. If the kinge bee entitled by office or other matter of recorde that is trauerſable, Howbeit there is no cauſe of trauerſe for that the office or recorde is true, in this caſe anye manne that hath right to the poſſeſſion of the freeholde of this lande whiche in ſhewinge of his right is able to confeſſe this office and auoid it, ſhalbee receyued if hee bee putte out of hys poſſeſſion or greeued thereby to come into the Chauncerie and ſhewe his ſaide right, which beinge there proued to be true, iudgement ſhalbee geeuen that the kinges handes be amoued from the poſſeſſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaide landes with the meane iſſues and proftes to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the party that ſueth the ſaid <hi>Monſtraunce de droit</hi> As for an example, it is founde by office that the kinges te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt by knightes ſeruice in chiefe dyed ſeiſed of certeine landes whiche are deſcended to his heir being within age, where in dede in his life time I recouered this land againſt him, and ſuing no execution ſuffred him to dye ſeiſed therof, now vpon this office returned into the Chauncerie ſhall I come &amp; ſhewe my right, that is to ſaye, this recouere and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre that this lande founde by office is the lande that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered or parcell thereof, which being ſo proued and tried I ſhall haue an <hi>Ouſter le maine.</hi> Like law it is if the kings tenaunt diſſeiſed me of thoſe landes, and I made my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall claime, or that I had title to enter for condicion bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the ſaide landes in the life of the kinges tenaunt, and I entred and after was diſſeiſed by him. But <hi>quere</hi> if I did not enter in his life, whether now I may bee holpen by a <hi>Monſtraunce de droit</hi> vppon the kinges poſſeſſion. And me thinkes not becauſe I haue noe righte in that caſe till I enter, for vntill that time the right continueth ſtill in hym, ſo that the kinge then hath a right ere I haue a right which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18351:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> ought too bee preferred and take place ſince it is but for a tyme before myne. And for theſe caſes ſee the booke in .3. H 7. fo. 2. But if the king bee entitled by matter of worde not trauerſable as if he be entytled by double matter of record, in this caſe I can not haue my <hi>Monſtraunce de droit</hi> no more than I can haue in the like caſe of Trauerſe, vnleſſe my title be founde by one of the ſaide recordes. As take the caſe to bee, It is founde by office that one ſuche that holdeth of the kinge diſſeiſed mee, and then committed a felonye, vppon whome I entred, after whiche entrie the ſaide te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt was attainted of the felonye, in this caſe I ſhal haue the lande out of the kings hands by a <hi>Monſtrance de droit cauſa qua ſupra.</hi> And yet the kinges tytle is here by a record and not trauerſable, that is to ſaye, thatteinder. But what than? My tytle is alſo founde by office, and appeareth by matter of recorde,<note place="margin">M. 3. E. 4. 26 A. 4.

H. 7.
